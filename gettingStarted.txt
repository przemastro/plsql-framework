Few steps need to be performed in order to use start using anonymous block and migration procedures:

 1. Create new tablespace and schema/users DB1 and DB2 - I mean just run 'tablespace' query in 'sql developer'
    new DB connection. In this example I configured connection as 'admin' with login:'sys' and password:'admin'.
 2. Create structure of schema DB1. Run in new query window 'DB1' query. Entire structure will be created including
    test data insert.
 3. And finally in DB2 schema run two queries: migration_structure_proc.sql and migration_data_proc.sql. This will add
    two procedures to DB2 schema. 

Below is an example how to migrate data and run anonymous block

   1. In DB2/Procedures run respectively: 'MIGRATION_STRUCTURE' and 'MIGRATION_DATA'.

   2. Open SqlPlus console and connect to your DB: 
      a) connect as sysdba
   3. Run query: @"path to the file"\report.sql and provide details
      a) Enter value for result_migration_file_path: c:\"some location"\result.html
	  b) Enter value for starName: "Denebola" - in this example
	  c) Enter value for recordsLimit: 20 - whatever you want 
 
Have a nice testing
